# Emacs Pastebin Interface

This is a huge inteface to pastebin.com. With it you can

- Paste buffers
- Fetch pastes
- Delete pastes
- Get a nice list of pastes
- Sort the pastes list by data, title, private, format, key

## Install

- Unpack the repo on ~/.emacs.d/lisp, create it if needed
- Run make to compile it (optional)
- Put it on path on your .emacs file
- Restart emacs

```bash
mkdir ~/.emacs.d/lisp/
cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp/
wget https://github.com/cnsunyour/emacs-pastebin/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
rm master.zip
cd emacs-pastebin-master/
make
```

Then put this on your `.emacs` file:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/emacs-pastebin-master/")
(require 'neopastebin)
(let ((credentials (auth-source-user-and-password "pastebin.com")))
  (pastebin-create-login :username "YOURUSER"
                         :dev-key (car credentials)
                         :password (cadr credentials)))
```

Or, use `use-package` like this:

```elisp
(use-package neopastebin
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/emacs-pastebin-master/"
  :defer t
  :commands
  pastebin-list-buffer-refresh
  pastebin-new
  :config
  (let ((credentials (auth-source-user-and-password "pastebin.com")))
    (pastebin-create-login :username "YOURUSER"
                           :dev-key (car credentials)
                           :password (cadr credentials))))
```

Before that, you should store `dev-key` and `password` in the `~/.authinfo.gpg` file:

```text
machine pastebin.com login YOURDEVKEY password YOURPASSWORD
```

Restart emacs or eval `.emacs` again. On emacs `M-x pastebin-list-buffer-refresh <RET>`. You should see a nice list of pastes on your screen right now.

## Usage

### Listing

M-x `pastebin-list-buffer-refresh` -> Fetch and list pastes on "list buffer".
After logged you can list your pastes with command `pastebin-list-buffer-refresh`, just type pastebin-l and press TAB.

Here is a list of keybinds from list buffer.

```
RET -> fetch paste and switch to it
r ->   refresh list and list buffer
d ->   delete paste, you'll be asked for confirmation
t ->   order by title
D ->   order by date
f ->   order by format
k ->   order by key
p ->   order by private
```

### Creating a new paste

M-x `pastebin-new` -> if there's active region, create a new paste from current selection, otherwise create from the whole buffer.

The name of the paste is given from current buffer name
The format from buffers major mode
Prefix argument makes private
